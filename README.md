# powershell-tools
This is just a demonstration version of a PowerShell tool I created to automate a few small local/domain based windows configuration tasks.

This tool is just a demonstration version, you may need to change a few things in order for implementation into a different configuration. 
The .exe is for running the file as admin when necessary, as it is easier to run with dependencies in a windows enviroment. 
Do not run these commands unless you understand the programming intention, this is not a toy.
